Hi there! 
I’m a Ph.D. student at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, a trained computational social scientist, interested in socio-ecological systems.
My Ph.D. research focuses on assessing, modeling, and understanding the impacts of natural hazards (droughts) on social-ecological systems. I apply text mining, machine learning and natural language processing, and participatory modeling.
Next to my academic work, I’m deeply interested in sports analytics by the means of large-scale data analysis and the integration of computational tools into journalism.
